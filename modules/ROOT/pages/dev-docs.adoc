This page will give you the basics when you want to work on Lookyloo's
source code.

We assume here that you already xref:install-lookyloo.adoc[installed the platform]
and gave it a try.

== General guidelines

* After editing a file, you can run the `stop` and `start` scripts to restart the platform and see the changes.
  It will restart everything, including the valkey databases, and can take a bot of time. See below if you're
  working on a specific part of the tool and want to stop/start a specific module.
* You can disable individual services by commenting them out in `bin/start.py`
* All the services can be started/killed manually (`CTRL+c` to kill)

== Scripts

* `start`: Starts all the services
* `stop`: Triggers `shutdown`, stop valkey databases.
* `shutdown`: Requests the services to stop by putting a `shutdown` key in valkey, wait for all of them to stop.
* `run_backend`: Starts/stops valkey databases
* `async_capture`: Triggers a capture from the queue. Multiple instances of this process can be run in parallel
* `background_indexer`: Caches the captures in valkey, creates the tree pickles, adds the urls, cookies,
  and body hashes in indexes for fast lookup
* `archiver`: Archives the old captures (default: 180+ days), maintain the indexes files in the capture directories
* `processing`: Triggers actions happening once a day. Currently: creates the user-agent file of the users of the platform (if enabled)
* `start_website`: Starts the website (launches gunicorn processes)

A few scripts are for maintenance only:
* `rebuild_caches`: clears the cache database, they will need to be rebuild for lookyloo to work
* `update`: Used in production to update lookyloo from git.


== Website

All the files related exclusively to the web interface and the API are in the `website` directory.

If you're working on the web interface, you probably want to comment out `start_website` in `bin/start.py`,
and start/kill it manually.

[IMPORTANT]
If you change anything in `website/web/static/` you must run `tools/generate_sri.py`
before restarting the website in order to update the link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity[SRI hashes]
of each resources. If you don't do that, your browser will refuse to load them and you will be frustrated.
Or set `ignore_sri` to `true` in `config/generic.json` in order to ignore the SRI hashes.

== Modules

* `lookyloo.py`: Main class, does all the heavy lifting to trigger the capture and access the results.
* `modules.py`: Connectors to xref:lookyloo-integration.adoc[3rd party modules].
* `indexing.py`: Indexer for URLs, hashes, and cookies (creation and access).
* `context.py`: Manage contextualization of captures and specific entries.
* `abstractmanager.py`: Main class for all the services.
* `capturecache.py`: Gives access to a cached capture in a pythonic way.
* `helpers.py`: A bunch of methods useful all over the project.
* `exceptions.py`: The exceptions that can be emitted by different part of the project.
