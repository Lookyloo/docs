= Authentication

**Note**: The authentication system is very limited and currently only used for
processing-heavy requests, pushing captures to a MISP instance, and can be used to
prioritize users in a high-use lookyloo instance.

== Configure auth

In order to add a user, you need to edit the configuration file (`config/generic.json`), and add a
user in the `users` key, with the following format:

  {"username" : "password"}

or

  {"username" : ["password", "apikey"] }

In the first case, an API key will be automatically generated when you start the app.

**Note**: The API key is what you will need to use for the queries requiring an
authenticated user when you're using the API (link:https://pylookyloo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[PyLookyloo]).

**Note**: You can have multiple users, they will all have the same admin rights.

== Usage

To authenticate your session, open `http://your.lookyloo.instance/login`.

When logged in, you have access to the following URLs:

* `/hidden`: show the tree hidden on the index
* `/rebuild_cache`: rebuild only the valkey cache. Can take a while, but not as much as `/rebuild_all`
* `/rebuild_all`: rebuild all the tree (drop all the pickles of all the trees). **warning**: it can take a very, very long time.
* `/logout`: drop the session
* `/tree/<string:tree_uuid>/rebuild`: rebuild the tree
* `/tree/<string:tree_uuid>/hide`: hide the tree from the index
* `/tree/<string:tree_uuid>/mark_as_legitimate`:  [if enabled] mark every URL/content as known
* `/tree/<string:tree_uuid>/misp_push`: [if enabled] push a capture to the MISP instance
* `/tree/<string:tree_uuid>/url/<string:node_uuid>/add_context`: [if enabled] add a specific resource in a category
* `/json/<string:tree_uuid>/misp_push`: [if enabled] [API only] push a capture to the MISP instance
